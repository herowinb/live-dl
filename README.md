# Stop process
kill 94552
```

## How update new image docker (new live-dl) on Synology NAS Docker

Search my Docker Image `herowinb/live-dl` in Registry tab with keyword `live-dl`. Wait to complete download new image.
Stop your Container `live-dl` running, update/edit new `config.yml`, `keyword.txt` or new config file â€¦ (if need). On your Container `live-dl` select Action and Clear then Start your Container again, it will update to new Image `live-dl`.

## How monitor member only stream

This feature help who joined membership but cannot watch live (time zone problem, busy with work or life) but don't want to miss out un-archive member only streams. Please remember that SHARING with non-members is **PROHIBITED**.

You need to login YouTube with an account joined membership of the channel to monitor, then export `cookies.txt` (for Youtube.com only) using the [Firefox addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/) or [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc). Rename to `cookies_membership.txt` and move it to `config` folder.
When your cookies.txt expired too quickly, check [this](https://github.com/herowinb/live-dl/issues/24).

Note:
  * You should **NOT** replace your `cookies.txt` with `cookies.txt` generated by `live-dl`. You can use `LONG INTERVAL` below to avoid YouTube seeing your account as a bot.
  * You can not take archive chat with member only stream.
  * Cookies may expire after a while of use and you need to update/replace it. A warning message will be sent via discord if cookies are expired.
  * In case Live-dl can not detect member-only Video ID, you can use option `-mb` to manual monitor/download.

  ```shell
  live-dl -mb https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxxx
  ```

## How use long interval

New option `LONG INTERVAL` in `config.yml`, it helps live-dl not run too much. If detect upcoming time longer than `LONG INTERVAL`, live-dl will use `LONG INTERVAL`.

You should set `LONG INTERVAL` between 600 (10 minutes) and 1800 (30 minutes) to make sure `live-dl` not miss guerrilla/RTA stream.

```shell
live-dl -i 60 -li 900 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxxxxxxxxxxxx/community
```

## How use Discord notification

Push notification via Discord DM. If you want to push notification for a channel, please use Pingcord.

Create an Application and a Bot at https://discord.com/developers/, copy Bot token to `config.yml` file. Because Bot can not create a DM to User at first time and User can not add friend or find Bot to make a DM, you need follow this:
* Create a temp Discord server, add your Bot to temp server (change xxxx = client ID in application) https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=xxxx&scope=applications.commands
* Click to Bot on Server User list (right panel) and send a Private Message to bot
* Open https://discord.com/channels/@me/ on browser, select your Bot and copy channel ID (numbers after /@me/, put **between two `"`**) in to `config.yml` file
* You can delete temp Discord server
